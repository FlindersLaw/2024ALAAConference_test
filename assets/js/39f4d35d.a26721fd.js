South Australia is the first\nAustralian State to create a First Nations Voice in response to the Statement. While the 2023\nnational referendum on enshrining an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice in the\nAustralian federal Constitution failed, there is potential for implementing Voices at the sub-\nnational level. The South Australian experience can serve as an experiment on how State-\nbased Voices may operate. The legislation to establish a South Australian First Nations Voice\npassed at a special sitting of the South Australian Parliament and was assented to by the\nGovernor of South Australia in a special meeting of Executive Council on the steps of\nParliament House in March 2023. A State Ceremony was held to mark the occasion. A year\nlater, in March 2024, South Australia\u2019s First Nations people voted for members of Local First\nNations Voices for the first time. The chairs of these Local Voices will form the State First\nNations Voice. The Voices are expected to commence their work in the second half of 2024.\nThis paper explains how the Voices will operate under the First Nations Voice Act 2023 (SA),\nincluding their engagement with the SA Parliament and Government. It also reflects on the\nelectoral process, including nomination of candidates and the election mechanism. It\ndiscusses early commentary on whether the Voice may be 'a fresh bridge that [First Nations\npeople] can walk on' 1 or a \u2018divisive and race-based\u2019 2 \u2018joke\u2019 3 . The paper assesses the SA\nVoice\u2019s potential as a legal future in the aftermath of the referendum."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},6114:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{y:()=>o});n(6540);var a=n(6696),r=n(9321),i=n(8759),s=n(4848);function o(e){let{sKey:t,children:n}=e;return(0,s.jsxs)(s.Fragment,{children:[(0,s.jsx)("h1",{children:a.FD[t].title}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:i.A.csContainer,children:[(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:i.A.csSessionNormal,children:n}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:i.A.csLearnButton,children:(0,s.jsx)(r.Px,{learnURL:a.FD[t].learnURL})})]})]})}},6696:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{FD:()=>i,q_:()=>a,xm:()=>r});const a=["A","B","C"],r="idNoSession",i={idNoSession:{title:"No session programmed",presenters:"",abstractURL:"",learnURL:""},id1_A1:{title:"Automating Empirical Legal Research: the Case of British and Australian Judgments",presenters:"Ben Chen",abstractURL:"/docs/abstracts/1a",learnURL:"TBC1"},id1_A2:{title:"Enhancing Negotiation Skills in Legal Education: Harnessing Artificial Intelligence through a Chat Bot Approach",presenters:"Dr Tammy Johnson",abstractURL:"/docs/abstracts/2a",learnURL:"TBC2"},id1_A3:{title:"Building GenAI into Law Assessments: How do students use genAI when given the chance?",presenters:"Samantha Kontra, Senior Lecturer, Flinders University",abstractURL:"tbc",learnURL:"TBC3"},id1_A4:{title:"Magic Defeat Magic?
