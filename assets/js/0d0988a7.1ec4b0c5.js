This presentation draws on mixed method research conducted by the author (empirical and\ndoctrinal. Evidence to support the arguments of this study will, partly, be based on interviews with collaboratively\ntrained legal practitioners that the author has already conducted but, its results, have not yet been published\nelsewhere. The interviews highlighted some advantages of the collaborative practice approach, including\nimproved client management, effective use of neutral experts, more practical and lasting outcomes for clients,\nthe scope for practitioner mentoring and skill development and the overall change in how collaboratively trained\nlawyers approach the adversarial process. Challenges included costs, management of positional clients or\nlawyers, and finding the balance to ensure the matter proceeds at a pace both clients are satisfied with."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The presentation will argue that although collaborative law or collaborative practice, defined as agreement to\nwork together and use a cooperative process rather than adversarial strategies and litigation to resolve conflict, 4\nhas its roots in family law, the underpinning principles are more broadly applicable to developing holistic,\noutcome-driven lawyers who can combat the long delays and excessive costs of the adversarial system 5 and\nachieve greater equity and social justice outcomes in the civil legal system. 6 Those without collaborative\npractitioner accreditation will not offer it to their clients, so it is currently left to clients to seek it as an option for\nthemselves. The presentation concludes that rather than being seen as an \u201calternative\u201d and an elective that only\nsome students may choose, the principles of collaborative practice have relevance and benefit to all law students\nand should be taught consistently throughout the law degree. 7"})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},6114:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{y:()=>o});n(6540);var a=n(6696),r=n(9321),i=n(8759),s=n(4848);function o(e){let{sKey:t,children:n}=e;return(0,s.jsxs)(s.Fragment,{children:[(0,s.jsx)("h1",{children:a.FD[t].title}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:i.A.csContainer,children:[(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:i.A.csSessionNormal,children:n}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:i.A.csLearnButton,children:(0,s.jsx)(r.Px,{learnURL:a.FD[t].learnURL})})]})]})}},6696:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{FD:()=>i,q_:()=>a,xm:()=>r});const a=["A","B","C"],r="idNoSession",i={idNoSession:{title:"No session programmed",presenters:"",abstractURL:"",learnURL:""},id1_A1:{title:"Automating Empirical Legal Research: the Case of British and Australian Judgments",presenters:"Ben Chen",abstractURL:"/docs/abstracts/1a",learnURL:"TBC1"},id1_A2:{title:"Enhancing Negotiation Skills in Legal Education: Harnessing Artificial Intelligence through a Chat Bot Approach",presenters:"Dr Tammy Johnson",abstractURL:"/docs/abstracts/2a",learnURL:"TBC2"},id1_A3:{title:"Building GenAI into Law Assessments: How do students use genAI when given the chance?",presenters:"Samantha Kontra, Senior Lecturer, Flinders University",abstractURL:"tbc",learnURL:"TBC3"},id1_A4:{title:"Magic Defeat Magic?
